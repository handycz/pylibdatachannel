# pylibdatachannel
Minimal Python wrapper for [libdatachannel](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libdatachannel) (C++ WebRTC network library) using [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io).

The library currently only supports minimal API needed by my use case, but contributions to extend the API are welcome.

## Versions
The library uses Semver that does not match the version of *libdatachannel*. The table below shows relation between the wrapper and library versions.
